The Rayla Framework is a terminal Python based software that makes ethical hacking and penetration testing more simple for people who are beginning their hacking career or who want to simplify the process of penetration testing.

Although the Rayla Framework is a great place to start learning ethical hacking, I recommend learning how to use tools like Aircrack-ng, Metasploit, and others used in the Rayla Framework outside of Rayla's environment to truly understand how these tools work.
